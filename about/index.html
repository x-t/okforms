            <h2>okforms</h2>
            <em>An open platform for forms and polls</em>
            <h3><span class="fas fa-check-circle"></span> Forms</h3>
            <p>
                With the simple form creator you can create forms fast for absolutely no cost. 
                Protect your form's answers with a password that's surprisingly not encoded in 
                plain text.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="fas fa-chart-pie"></span> Polls</h3>
            <p>
                Create polls instantly with many answer options. 
            </p>
            <h3><span class="fas fa-user-secret"></span> Completely anonymous</h3>
            <p>
                You don't need an account to create or vote on a form. In fact, 
                this service does not support any registration.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="fab fa-osi"></span> Open source</h3>
            <p>

                making okforms free (libre) software.

            <p>
                The source code of okforms does not depend on any frameworks, everything was 
                written from scratch with the intent to be fast and compatible. You can vote 
                on forms and polls from even w3m.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="far fa-file-code"></span> Export options</h3>

                Export your form's answers as XML and JSON formats. Your form's answers 
                will stay even if the form expired.
            </p>
